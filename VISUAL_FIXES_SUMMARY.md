# 🎨 Visual Design Fixes & Imagery Upgrade - Complete Summary

## ✅ What Was Just Fixed

### 1. Typography Cleanup
**Issue:** Italic styling on section headings looked unprofessional
**Solution:** Removed all italic classes from major headings
**Affected Sections:**
- "What we are about" ✅
- "Our Rooms" ✅
- "Activities Around" ✅
- "Upcoming Surf Weeks" ✅

**Result:** Cleaner, more professional appearance. Normal font weight provides better readability and modern aesthetic.

### 2. Our Rooms Section Redesign
**Issue:** Layout was chaotic with overlapping elements and cramped spacing

**Changes Made:**
```
Before:
├── h-64 image (too small)
├── Cramped card layout
├── No visual breathing room
└── Confusing element overlap

After:
├── h-80 image (better showcase)
├── Proper relative container wrapper
├── Better p-6 spacing throughout
├── Hover shadow effects (depth)
├── Line-clamped descriptions
└── Clear visual hierarchy
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- Image carousels now 320px tall (vs 256px) = 25% more visibility
- Better showcase of room details
- More breathing room around content
- Professional hover states with shadow transitions
- Descriptions properly clipped to prevent overflow

---

### 3. Color Brand Consistency 🎨
**Issue:** Review section used blue (not brand colors) - inconsistent branding

**Changes Made:**

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Review icon | Blue (#1e40af) | Heiwa Orange (#ec681c) |
| Verified badge | Blue (#1e40af) | Heiwa Orange (#ec681c) |
| Review button | Blue-600 → Blue-700 | Orange + hover animation |
| Review avatars | Blue-500 | Heiwa Orange (#ec681c) |

**Result:** Unified brand color across entire site. Orange accent now consistent everywhere, strengthening brand identity.

**Implementation Details:**
- Updated all review card avatars
- Changed verification checkmark color
- Updated button with proper hover states (orange → darker orange)
- Added inline styles with smooth transitions
