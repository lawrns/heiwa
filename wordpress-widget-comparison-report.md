## Issues Identified

   - **Status**: Consistent behavior across both implementations
   - **Proposed Fix**: Add default pricing or better loading states

2. **Total Price Calculation**

   - **Impact**: High - incorrect pricing could affect bookings
   - **Status**: Consistent issue across both implementations
   - **Proposed Fix**: Review pricing calculation logic in BookingWidget component
